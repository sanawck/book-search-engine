# book-search-engine

https://sanawck.github.io/book-search-engine/

this project was to create an app that allows users to search for books and save/delete from their account.

I was not able to get the save books and delete book functions to work.

I have successfully installed the Apollo server and GraphQL and also created the schemas.
I successflly deployed to Heroku
